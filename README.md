This mod provides a form to easily spawn L-system trees, aimed at mod developers
and power users.

Use the server command `/treeform` to open the form. If you use Unified Inventory,
there's a new button in your inventory menu for this. Usage help for this form is
provided in the form itself.

This mod also has an API for managing the tree database. See `API.md` for more
information.
