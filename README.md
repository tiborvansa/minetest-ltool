This mod provides a form to easily spawn L-system trees, aimed at mod developers
and power users.

Current version: 1.4.1

If you use one of the following mods, there's a new button in your inventory
menu for opening the form:

Alternatively, you can always use the server command `/treeform`.

Usage help for this form is provided in the form itself.
