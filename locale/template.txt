L-System Tree Sapling=
This artificial sapling does not come from nature and contains the genome of a genetically engineered L-system tree. Every sapling of this kind is unique. Who knows what might grow from it when you plant it?=
Place the sapling on any floor and wait 5 seconds for the tree to appear. If you have the “lplant” privilege, you can grow it instantly by using it. If you hold down the sneak key while placing it, you will keep a copy of the sapling in your inventory.=
To create your own saplings, you need to have the “lplant” privilege and pick a tree from the L-System Tree Utility (accessed with the server command “treeform”).=
L-System Tree Utility=
This gadget allows the aspiring genetic engineer to invent and change L-system trees, create L-system tree saplings and look at the inventions from other players. L-system trees are trees and tree-like strucures which are built by a set of (possibly recursive) production rules.=
Punch to open the L-System editor. A tabbed form will open. To edit and create trees, you need the “ledit” privilege, to make saplings, you need “lplant”. Detailed usage help can be found in that menu. You can also access the same editor with the server command “treeform”.=
Can add, edit, rename and delete own L-system tree definitions of the ltool mod=
Can place L-system trees and get L-system tree saplings of the ltool mod=

Distance=
This field is used to specify the distance (in node lengths) from your position@nin the viewing direction. It is ignored if you use coordinates.=
Randomness seed=
A number used for the random number generators. Identical randomness seeds will produce identical trees. This field is optional.=

No tree in database selected or database is empty.=
You are not allowed to plant trees anyway as you don't have the “lplant” privilege.=

Read-only mode. You need the “ledit” privilege to edit trees.=
Planting of trees is not allowed. You need to have the “lplant” privilege.=
You are using the L-System Tree Utility, version @1.=
The purpose of this utility is to aid with the creation of L-system trees. You can create, save, manage and plant L-system trees. All trees are saved into <world path>/ltool.mt on server shutdown.=
It assumes you already understand the concept of L-systems, this utility is mainly aimed towards modders and nerds.=
The usual workflow goes like this:=
1. Create a new tree in the "Edit" tab and save it=
2. Select it in the database=
3. Plant it=
To help you get started, you can create an example tree for the "Edit" tab by pressing this button:=
Create template=
The database contains a list of all created trees among all players.=
Each tree has an "owner". This kind of ownership is limited: The owner may rename, change and delete their own trees, everyone else is prevented from doing that. But all trees can be copied freely by everyone.=
To do so, simply hit "Copy tree to editor", change the name and hit "Save tree to database". If you like someone else's tree definition, it is recommended to make a copy for yourself, since the original owner can at any time choose to delete or edit the tree. The trees which you "own" are written in a yellow font, all other trees in a white font.=
In order to plant a tree, you have to select a tree in the database first.=
To plant a tree from a previously created tree definition, first select it in the database, then open the "Plant" tab. In this tab, you can directly place the tree or request a sapling.=
If you choose to directly place the tree, you can either specify absolute or relative coordinates or specify that the tree should be planted in your viewing direction. Absolute coordinates are the world coordinates as specified by the "x", "y", and "z" fields. Relative coordinates are relative to your position and use the same fields. When you choose to plant the tree based on your viewing direction, the tree will be planted at a distance specified by the field "distance" away from you in the direction you look to.=
When using coordinates, the "distance" field is ignored, when using direction, the coordinate fields are ignored.=
You can also use the “lplant” server command to plant trees.=
If you got a sapling, you can place it practically anywhere you like to. After placing it, the sapling will be replaced by the L-system tree after 5 seconds, unless it was destroyed in the meantime.=
All requested saplings are independent from the moment they are created. The sapling will still work, even if the original tree definiton has been deleted.=
To create a L-system tree, switch to the "Edit" tab.=
When you are done, hit "Save tree to database". The tree will be stored in the database. The "Reset fields" button resets the input fields to defaults.=
To understand the meaning of the fields, read the introduction to L-systems.=
All trees must have an unique name. You are notified in case of a name clash. If the name clash is with one of your own trees, you can choose to replace it.=
