L-System Tree Sapling=
This artificial sapling does not come from nature and contains the genome of a genetically engineered L-system tree. Every sapling of this kind is unique. Who knows what might grow from it when you plant it?=
Place the sapling on any floor and wait 5 seconds for the tree to appear. If you have the “lplant” privilege, you can grow it instantly by using it. If you hold down the sneak key while placing it, you will keep a copy of the sapling in your inventory.=
To create your own saplings, you need to have the “lplant” privilege and pick a tree from the L-System Tree Utility (accessed with the server command “treeform”).=
L-System Tree Utility=
This gadget allows the aspiring genetic engineer to invent and change L-system trees, create L-system tree saplings and look at the inventions from other players. L-system trees are trees and tree-like strucures which are built by a set of (possibly recursive) production rules.=
Punch to open the L-System editor. A tabbed form will open. To edit and create trees, you need the “ledit” privilege, to make saplings, you need “lplant”. Detailed usage help can be found in that menu. You can also access the same editor with the server command “treeform”.=
Can add, edit, rename and delete own L-system tree definitions of the ltool mod=
Can place L-system trees and get L-system tree saplings of the ltool mod=

Trunk type=
Tree trunk type. Possible values:@n- "single": trunk of size 1×1@n- "double": trunk of size 2×2@n- "crossed": trunk in cross shape (3×3).=
Thin branches=
If enabled, all branches are just 1 node wide, otherwise, branches can be larger.=

Fruit chance (%)=

Maximum number of iterations, usually between 2 and 5.=

Absolute coordinates=
Relative coordinates=
Distance in viewing direction=
- "Absolute coordinates": Fields "x", "y" and "z" specify the absolute world coordinates where to plant the tree=
- "Relative coordinates": Fields "x", "y" and "z" specify the relative position from your position=
- "Distance in viewing direction": Plant tree relative from your position in the direction you look to, at the specified distance=
x=
Field is only used by absolute and relative coordinates.=
y=
z=
Distance=
This field is used to specify the distance (in node lengths) from your position@nin the viewing direction. It is ignored if you use coordinates.=
Randomness seed=
A number used for the random number generators. Identical randomness seeds will produce identical trees. This field is optional.=
Plant tree=
Immediately place the tree at the specified position=
This gives you an item which you can place manually in the world later=
No tree in database selected or database is empty.=
You are not allowed to plant trees anyway as you don't have the “lplant” privilege.=
